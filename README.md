# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

I Have made a personal page using basically my curriculum as content.
 - On the index I have included biitstrap, CSS and SCSS styles and ended up using most of them in all other pages. Here I have only included a headshot , a menu that I have kept in all pages and a short professional description
 - Other pages follow the same addressing the project requirements, such as list on the education page and the table on the experience page. I have added a form in order to provide both a 4th page but also use more of bootstrap styles.
